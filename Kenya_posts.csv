wrdvyb,Kenya,1660810818.0,"I was arrested yesterday at Globe Roundabout. They suspected me of being in possession of weed, which I was. The 4 officers(in civilian clothing) wanted to search me and I knew I was fucked. But your guy knows the constitution.

 1. You have the right to privacy, which means you can refuse to be searched.
2. If arrested, the police officer should identify him/herself and give a valid reason for arrest.

I used this knowledge and my Zeus-level confidence to gain power over the officers. If you've ever been arrested before, you know that the police often use intimidation tactics to scare you. So they put me in chains and threatened to take me to Central.

 ""Tukikupata na bangi ata moja kijana, utajua."" 
""Mimi sivutangi io vitu, nipeleke station tuambiane na wakubwa wenyu""

We eventually get to Central, and the officers ask me to stop. 

""Kijana toa bangi""
""Nawaambia sina bangi, kwanini tumesimama, situingie""

The officers take me to their store room or something and continue with the threats. My heart was beating hard af but I ain't no b***h. I was willing to call their bluff.

One of the officers suggests, ""Huyu tumpeleke kwa mkubwa."" So they call the ""mkubwa,"" who tells them to bring me in. Luckily, the mkubwa is a cool lady. I tell her my situation, that I was arrested and the police tried to violate my rights. After a lengthy conversation they realized I knew the law and I was finally released. I also used this line to play with their minds, ""Kama ningekuwa na bangi, singeitikia wanilete station, tungemalizana kwa barabara."" Worked like a charmüòÇ

You should have seen me walking through the Central corridor, with a bag of weed in my pockets. You remember that scene in infinity war where thanos gets all infinity stones. I could feel myself powering up(from the power I just absorbed from the officers) I AM INEVITABLE

Anyways, I am typing this high as f***. Mimi si mjeuri officer, I was just trying to survive.

rxb663,Kenya,1641463914.0,"Long post ahead

So, yesterday, i went grocery shopping a bit late and got home at around 7. The main entrance to our apartment was locked, and i neighbor is outside the gate waiting for someone to come to his aid. I make fun of his situation & open the gate as i head to my house. Our appartment isn't big , so even though i hardly know anyone by name... I have lived in the same house and building for two years so i know my neighbors faces. This guy in particular, i had spoken to, just the usual greetings, trying to be a friendly neighbor, a couple of times. So the guy thanks me for letting him in, and proposes that he comes to my place for dinner. Naturally, i am an introvert, i rarely have people in my house, but part of my new year resolution is to be more friendly & meet new people. This is my neighbor, he lives a floor below me & i literally have to pass by his apartment every time i have to go in & out of the apartment building. He has been living in the apartment for over an year, he seems harmless enough so i agree.
I head to my house, prepare my meal & its around 9 when i am done. I don't have his number so i decide to wait for a few minutes to see if he will show up or not. about 10 minutes later, he shows up. with him there i take the necessary precautions i usually take while hanging out with new people. I text my sister his details and don't lock the door. I am not about to lock a stranger in the house with myself. I put on a movie which i love and serve us food. We eat, he is great company. 
We finish eating we finish up the movie while making small talk here and there.
Like an hour in, the guy turns to me & says i have something to tell you, i am like ok, go on. The guy says he has seen me around for the past year & he likes me. I give an awkward ""ok"" he proceeds to ask, so what are we going to do about it. I respond, ""nothing, I don't know you."" He insists that i know him we live in the same apartment, he literally lives in the apartment below me. I tell him that is not enough information for me to consider it knowing a person. He insists that i know him. I insist that i dont. At this point its getting weird so i say i am sleepy it is time for him to leave. The guy says he will not leave without a kiss. I insist no. He asks why. I say I don't want to. Plus i am in a relationship. This guy lives next to the apartment entrance, i am a hundred percent sure he has seen me & my boyfriend coming in & out of the appartment severally. I insist that i would never do anything to jeopardize my relationship. He tells me my boyfriend is not around so he won't know. I affirm that i will know, kissing him is wrong whether my boyfriend knows or not so i will not do it. This guy will not take a no for an answer. So i suggest, i will give him a peck or maybe a kiss when he is at the door on his way out. My thought process is when he is up,i will push him out & lock the door. The guy refuses, he insists that i must give him s kiss there, on the sofa. I insist i won't. 
At this point i just want the guy to leave my house. Two things you need to know, i am petite & i live in a studio apartment. So this guy at this point carries me to my bed and gets on top of me. I am freaking out at this point. I am pushing him away but he is not having it. Compared to him...i have no chance. I am kicking, shoving, shaking my whole body. He is not having it. I am shouting at this point. He is telling me to relax as he forcibly tries to push his fingers through my short. I am wiggling around & making the whole thing so difficult. I ask the guy ""what do you think you are doing?"" At this point i am frustrated. I have told him multiple times to get off me. He is not bulging. I have told him countless times that i do not want to do whatever he want, he is not bulging. The guy replies that we are having sex. I tell him this is not sex, he is trying to rape me. The guy does not bulge. Rather, he seems frustrated with my continued refusal and puts one of his hand on my neck. At this point i am scared shitless. I literally think this is how i am going to die. He pins me down. At this point in my head all i can think of is the last thing that would happen to me in my life is have someone rape me in my own home. I would rather die.
I try reaching around but the only thing i can reach is a pillow, that wont do any damage. I am scared, he is almost getting through my shorts. So i decide it a do or die situation. He was so focused on getting my short off that he was not paying attention on the hand on my neck. I manage to bite him. He gets it off. I tell him to get off me or i will scream. Remember the door is open. This scares him, he gets of me. I tell him to get out of my house. He scatters. At the door he has the audacity to say ""see you tomorrow"".
I get back in the house & lock the door. I am scared. My neck is sore. I can feel some pain on my shoulder. I cant believe what just happened. I am staring at the celling for hours trying to digest the whole thing. Its 4am the next time i check the clock. I haven't slept at all. Every small movement frightens me. What if he tries to break into my house & tries it again. I finally drift off.
I am awake again at 6am.
I cant even bring myself to believe what happened. I am a bit calmer now so i can think rationally. I wonder what the guys thought process was. Why would anyone want to rape a neighbor knowing very well that we would see each other every day. I can identify him to the police.
I think about reporting the case, but what would i say. I live in Kenya. Just like most African countries, rape cases here are not given the seriousness it deserves. Attempted rape cases are even worse in this case. What would i even say. Would anyone believe me? People would think i asked for it simply because i let the guy in my house at night. If i reported it, i literally had zero evidence of the whole thing, i don't know if neighbors had the exchange. If anyone had, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't come to my aid. I feel broken. A bit lost. I just don't understand what i did wrong. Even if the penetration did not happen, i kinda understand why people do not report such cases. 
I called my sister in the morning & told her what happened. I am still scared. I still have to see this guy every day. I want to tell my boyfriend but i don't know how he will react, he is unpredictable. I want to forget the whole thing but i don't know how. For F**ksake, i have been locked up in my house the whole day. I know i need to get out at some point.

I don't know how to deal with the whole thing. I remember the face the guy had when i made it clear that what he was trying to do was rape. He wasn't shocked. That is what scared me the most. Clearly he has done this before, he probably might do it again. & That is what breaks my heart the most. I like to think i am strong & independent but never have i ever felt so weak in my life. I can't even bring myself to expose his face. I don't know how to deal honestly. Psychologically i am a mess. So much for meeting new people this year..




UPDATE
I HAVE REPORTED THE CASE TO THE POLICE. HE ADMITTED WHAT HE DID, SO THAT GIVES ME A BIT OF PEACE. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR SUPPORT & ADVICE, IT REALLY GAVE ME THE STRENGTH I NEEDED. I HAVE ALSO SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY BOYFRIEND & FAMILY. THANK YOU EVERY ONE.

FINAL UPDATE....After i reported the case to the police, the guy was arrested & spent the night in a police cell. Looking back at the whole thing, i admit that i did make some wrong calls along the way but even so, that does not give anyone the right to force themselves on me. All i wanted from the situation was for the guy to know what he did was wrong. That actions have consequences so that in future, he understands that if & when he choses to engage in any form of sexual contact, both parties should be in agreement. I made the personal decision not to take the case to court but rather, have the guy experience some form consequences for his actions. The guy will be moving out of the appartment. Also, he has to make weekly visits to the police station for assessment & punishment. Hopefully, he learns from this experience.
I want to thank all of you for the kind words & support & thank the very good ladies at the sexual and gbv office at the police station i reported the case at. At no point during my interaction with them did i feel judged. They were very helpful & understanding. All i can do now is try & put this situation behind me and move on. Lessons were learnt. I am no way close to recovery, but i will definitely be taking it one day at a time...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/rxb663/almost_got_raped_yesterday/,Almost got raped yesterday,,220,154,0.97

My mother will be forced to bury her son. She left home at night crying uncontrollablly heading for Eldoret. He wasn't even in Nairobi when he died and the silence from his friends who had taken him to the hospital made us realize he wasn't going to make it. In 4 hours I have to do a paper and I still have my last paper on Tuesday. I still have to find an attachment for September period. I finally thought this was the year for our family. Everything had been going great up until around a month ago when my brother fell ill again. He'd had pulmonary embolism in 2018 but he survived. The doctor told him he had nerve damage and myalgia and gave him some meds a month ago. I am miserable.

vr3uxv,Kenya,1656928449.0,"20s can be the pits! Been there. Its like getting lost in an alien forest in an uninhabited alien world. But never give up. Here is my story - perhaps it can help someone out there who is losing all hope.

My story: I was supposed to graduate from uni in 2008, but i got suspended, and ended up graduating 3 yrs later in 2010. Then my father refused to pay my uni fees and living expenses, and left home to chase skirts with gratuity money. I found a job in a cyber. Back then surfing the internet using airtime was too expensive so everyone went to cybers. My mom really helped me out. Cleared my fees and supported me until i graduated. But when you have studied law, graduating out of uni is nothing. You cannot be employed unless as a clerk. You must go to Kenya School of Law for 1 year, then pupillage for 6 months, get admitted, then get employed as the lowest ranking ""punda"" in a law firm. KSL fees had doubled from 45k, to 90k then 190k, then add living expenses. KSL easily meant you spending not less than 300k.

We didn't have 300k let alone 190k fees. So i stayed at home as my uni classmates, finished KSL, got jobs in law firms, ODPP, judiciary, NGOs and what not. I could not face anyone. Sent applications everywhere but everyone wanted a lawyer who has been admitted to the bar. I became a shamba boy helping my mom feed cows, planting cabbages, going barefoot to cut napier grass for the cows etc. I would rarely leave our farm lest be seen by neighbors and provide the week's gossip. 

I hit the lowest of low but i never sank to drinking or drugs or fapping or contemplated suicide. aAll my boxers were so old, but i had no money to buy new ones and i could not ask my mom. Did not want to burden her more. The manual/physical farm labour kept my mind and body busy. I would work on the farm even when its raining unless the rain became hard, until darkness forced me to call it a day. The next day, the same thing. 

By sheer luck, we got some kiasi windfall and by then, i had given up on law altogether and resolved to do business or something else but not law. That lady convinced me to go back to KSL and finish, get admitted and then come back and pursue whatever i wanted. I did not want to but i listened. Went back to KSL in 2013 (5 yrs after my uni classmates), a month late after reporting date. So much was alien in the legal field, new constitution, new land laws, new police laws etc. Threw myself so hard at studies from Feb to Dec, sleeping only 4-6 hrs during that time. 

Hard work saved me. Life totally changed after KSL. I am can't believe that i am living a life that i could not even dare dream of. So chin up and grind on, or hang in there. The best is yet to come.

And oh, in 2011-12, I lived in Majengo slums where when i wanted to go and eat or buy from a shp, i carried only 50/- or 100/- and my ID. In case cops stopped me, my would show them my ID, in case thugs stopped me, they will only steal the 50/- or 100/-. My body would take a whole week without doing a number 2 because the toilets where i stayed were... wacha tu! On sundays, i would go to a new toilet at Gikosh and pay 20/- and stay inside for 1 hr, just enjoying how a clean toilet is.

I still recall those days and believe that nothing will ever faze me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/vr3uxv/the_20s_can_be_the_pits_but/,The 20s can be the pits but..,,181,33,0.99

Just alighted from the matatu from naivasha and asked a man for directions. He gave me directions and he started asking me for money. He actually demanded it. He started shouting saying I have his money and I am refusing to give him. I gave him 100ksh because I didn't like the attention. 

3days in and my phone was stolen. I went to the police and they asked me to pay 5k to track it. The phone itself cost 6k. Haha. 

I didn't give up and my aunt gave me some money to buy another phone. 

I was scammed out of money in eastleigh. 

I try to ask for directions from people, either they ignore me or are rude. 

I asked for a mat to go to kariorkor and the guy told me I had the right matatu. I paid 100 only to find out other people paid less. He didn't even take me to kariorkor. He took me to town. I took a motorbike and the guy demanded I give him 500. 

I have lived in naivasha most of my life and never been scammed. You can even walk at night with no problems. 

In short everyone in Nairobi seems to be out there for themselves. It seems like everyone is either trying to rob me or scam me..people don't even greet each other without wanting something.

sxy20r,Kenya,1645461960.0,"So, during the day today I noticed I didn't have enough cash to pay for my commute home from town and more importantly from home to town tomorrow morning. To my knowledge I knew I had a hundred bob note and 30 bob in coins. So I decided to withdraw 1000 bob from an mpesa (because lopha categorically refuse mpesa payments)

Because in the mornings kanges usually get asinine when you give them a 1000 bob note, I decided to pay with the 1000 bob and for good measure add the 30 bob so that I would get 950 bob change (fare is 80 bob to my destination). Anyway I pay and just chill and watch YouTube shorts knowing I'll get my change later. A short distance from my stage I remind the makanga to give me the balance......wacha jamaa aniruke. Ati, ""wewe mbuyu umelipa 80. Tunawajua sana wezi."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This idiot not only was he refusing to give me change, he had just called me a thief. Me, a father of boys. A respected banker. Admin of several WhatsApp groups.

I felt holy indignation rising through my veins. I wouldn't let this guy get away with this as a matter of principle. My inner John Wick rose to surface and for a moment I forgot I was 40 and overweight and I was ready to go toe to toe with the inbred. Wacha ni pige kelele nikimwambia mimi si rika yake. Wacha tu escalate kesi kwa CEO wa gari, dere. Dere ako hapo ame changanyikiwa wondering who to believe. Eventually wisdom rained on the driver and on discerning that I'm a respectable member of society, and makangas penchant for their unchristian ways, he told the nincompoop to give me back the change.

Feeling vindicated, as I walked away, I gave the conductor and the semiconductors that had congregated to witness the spectacle, a look to suggest that they should choose better prey the next time.

I get home and as I am dissecting the events that had just happened, I put my hand in one of my pockets and the unmistakable texture of a crisp 1000 bob is felt. Intact.

Edit: After weeks, I finally met the makanga. I asked for his number, he was confused because I made sure I had paid the fare with the exact change, I sent him a thousand bob. He finally remembered me and told me the way that money had pained him. I apologized and explained my side of the story. Tukasema poa poa with that nod. Mambo ikaisha.

Look, I am not against weddings at all.. if someone wants to have a grand wedding, you should have it, however, have a good chunk of money to finance it, be financially woke as well. I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine who told me about a friend of her's who convinced the husband to take a 250,000 loan for their wedding, and rally people on WhatsApp to contribute the other 250,000. Mind you these are people who live pay cheque to pay cheque..DO YOU WANT A MARRIAGE OR A WEDDING?..The idea that people are willing to splash huge amounts of money for 'the glitz and glam, get-people-talking' type of wedding, yet they will be back to eating  ugali and skuma for the next year or two has me questioning ALOT!..There is alot I can do with 500,000k ,splashing it in one day! To please a bunch of people I haven't  met in years, is the absolute least of my concerns. Some of the guests will still talk sh*** btw..I am okay going to the DC or whatever they are called these days, and have a wedding that costs maybe  Ksh10,000 because I am honest enough  to say 'I CAN'T AFFORD A WEDDING' ..My mum  has been given a target of 5000Ksh for just one wedding that she is supposed to contribute to..She is just a primary school teacher who doesn't earn much money, with my siblings school fees to pay, and now she has a ton of weddings asking her to contribute, January is on the corner...But my mother has to contribute to 'X weds Y'. I get the idea that people want to celebrate their love and all but  they should be honest with themselves,  Can they afford it? It's the COVID era and not many people have the luxury to contribute money to weddings, it's  the blunt truth. My mum is the type of person who will contribute because she doesn't want to come out as the 'mama who didn't changa' and she represents many people who are struggling to make ends meet.PUT ME IN A WHATSAPP GROUP TO RAISE FUNDS  FOR A FUNERAL, MEDICAL BILL, EDUCATION FUND and others, I will sacrifice my heart, soul and money in a second, NOT A WEDDING, its not an emergency..If anyone wants people  to support their wedding, they should have at the very least ,70-80% of the money. If not, postpone  it or go to the DC..People are struggling out here, don't pile on them unnecessary bills, it's a culture that needs  to stop..I am pretty sure there are other CRAZY wedding stories!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/rjrfwg/wedding_harambeesif_you_cannot_afford_a/,"WEDDING HARAMBEE'S!..IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD A WEDDING,DON'T HAVE A WEDDING",,162,63,0.97

I have a mixed feelings because that kind of money is so much to fathom considering that my previous job paid me $100- 150/ month.

I don't want to mess up because I was brought up in poverty and I know what being at the bottom feels like. It was only last week that I went 3 days without food and now I am literally one of the best paid people in Kenya.

I want to invest and move to a bigger house (currently living in a bedsitter and still single). I want to change my lifestyle without going broke, I need some financial advices that worked for you.

I am a 27 year old guy and I don't have any dependants. I only have a little bro who's in high school that I'll be supporting. Also, both of my parents are dead so I don't have anyone else to be sending money monthly.

Which platform do you use to invest? What are the ROIs? 

Your input will be highly appreciated.

EIT #2: I applied the job through LinkedIn. The interview process took 4 weeks because I was interviewed by 4 different people, takeaway assessment and had to go through a background check.

11rrzr4,Kenya,1678874668.0,"So in late January my dad committed suicide a few days after my birthday. He was always happy so everything happened so suddenly and it is hard to believe that happened. Anyway now that I look at you it my mum is also to blame. Fast forward my mum is a stay at home mum dad was the only breadwinner at home but everyday mum was always occupied with church stuff mara sijui chama........

Dad stopped going to church 2 years ago after the death of my sister ever since he started cutting people off and he would tell me how all this people I see around him aren't really his friends....he always stayed alone and he didn't associate with people. I didn't know what to tell him ju yeye cause he is older than me and plus I'm good not good at such stuff. He also used to tell me how he feels lonely at home cause my mum is usually not at home on Sundays and that is when my dad was free. So I used to go home almost every weekend so I can keep him company.

Then my uncles and aunties (his siblings) started having land issues and so he offered to cater for the land division etc ju he was a land surveyor they used to stress him out. And he had no one to talk to.  So fast forward to when he committed suicide.....

It was on a Friday he called me in the morning and asked me how school is I told him school is fine we talked for a while about how we would go take my sister to school for the form one admissions everything was fine when we talked. Until in the evening when I called him and my mum picks up my phone crying I asked her what is wrong and she told me that my dad was in hospital so I go home the next day and that's when I'm told what happened.....my dad died on Sunday.

I later found out that on that day at around midday he called everyone (apart from me) he was crying and even after all that nobody cared about where he was and what he was doing.......it hurts till this day but I understand why he did what he did  and now mentally I'm not okay I just wish I had someone to talk to",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/11rrzr4/my_dad_committed_suicide/,my dad committed suicide.......,Discussion,147,98,0.98

I don't know why but that just sounded very weird. I know they are not doing labels or anything but no one has the right to talk about a person that way. 

I also have a guy i have sex with but i will never reduce his whole existence as someone who gives me orgasm and makes me feel good and i will not go around talking about him as if he is a dildo.

The whole comment was uncalled for. He could have just replied ""i don't have a girlfriend but I am seeing someone casually ""  end of my rant.

The last Muratina was aged for 6 months with 8% abv alcohol, I decided to go a little overboard  by distilling it, after several failed attempts and getting ***drunk on my own supplies*** I have nailed it down and  here are the results *drums rolling......* 

 allow me to introduce the first ever in the History of traditional Kikuyu brewing Muratina liquor at staggering **40% ABV**, finally! a clean traditional spirit for Kenyans,   I used a copper coil condenser for distillation, achieved **100 proof** alcohol then aged the liquor by soaking Muratina pods in the liquor for 6 months to create complex chemical reactions that occur between the distillate spirit and the Muratina  to produce aromatic flavors on the palate and achieve that golden brown color, spring water *(spring water has minerals which add smooth taste and enhanced flavors )*  was used to dilute the liquor to 80 proof 40% ABV 

the flavor is honey like balanced with a herbal taste of the Muratina

I can only talk about this cause I've fully healed.Around 2018 I tried selling a PS4 Slim console on Jiji, for around Kes. 30,000/=

An Airtel number gives me a call claiming to be interested,me excited, knowing I'm gonna make a quick buck (I really was cash-strapped at the time) arranges a meeting.

The guy, who claimed to have a sick son at MP Shah Hosp. in Parklands and wanted to gift the boy this console, agreed we meet...In retrospect,he was full of red flags that I just didn't want to see.

So on the fateful day I take my ps4 slim,2 pads and FIFA 19, put them in a bag and leave for Parklands. I get near MP Shah,I call and call and call,no response. I'm now close to the hospital entrance I call again,no answer.

20 mins later this guy calls back, apparently he was in his sons ward but he's out now and in a White Toyota Premio and he's even seen me, he signals me,I go enter his ride (all holy car,small bible on the dash,crucifix hung on the rearview mirror, car stereo playing catholic songs)he checks the PS4 slim,and he likes it.

Now we have to leave the car and go to his ""office"" nearby so he can check if it powers on ""juu ashai conniwa hio Jiji akabuy ps4 yenye haiwaki""üòÇ

Bro,he even encourages me to leave the bag inside the vehicle ""itakua tu safe"" I comply,we leave the car he carries the Ps4 and leads the way to like a mini shop complex near-by.

Here goes the cold water. There was an upstairs space in this complex that was supposed to be his office,my mans alikua anapanda stairs 4 ama 5 at a time.Sijui alinipotelea aje...Mimi kufika juu,hio place ni salon/cosmetics shop. A lady dusting the counter.

""Umeona mtu amebeba Ps4 na pad mbili ameingia hapa sahii?""

""Ps4 ni nini,hakuna mtu ameingia hapa,ndio tunafungua kazi""came the reply. 

My buttcrack is sweating.Im nauseated.

Nikarudi chini mbio (equally 5 stairs at a time) headed to where our Premio was parked,Premio ni wewe.Haiko.Im feeling like puking,knees are weak.Hata fare ilikua kwa ile bag yetuüòÇüòÇ

Knees give in,I sit down on the gravel.watchman comes.""Kijana uko mgonjwa?"" Silence ""...Kijana...kijana unazuia watu ebu songa uketi kwa pavement!!""
Nimeibiwa.I meekly reply...

""Kuna Gari imetoka tu hapa sahii,amesema ako na emergency..."" Sweet baby Jesus!! I confirm my fears.Call the number...Mteja.

pon9ku,Kenya,1631700884.0,"Let‚Äôs not lie to ourselves. This country is a shithole. Bad governance, poor services and corruption is rife. Corruption is so ingrained into the Kenyan society I‚Äôm not even sure of the best way to solve that, if even possible. I blame one person, rather one family: the first family. 

In primary school we were taught that Jomo was a freedom fighter and the truth is that he was just a shitty shitty guy who Jaramogi let to be president just cause he was in good with ypipo. In power he shafted Jaramogi and stole half the country and shared with his fabled ‚Äúkikuyu mafia‚Äù (responsible for several high profile killings including that of JM Kariuki)

He started this cronyism we see that is so rife in our country right now. Kenya is not a meritocracy and it has never been. 

Years down the line his son has outdone his father in terms of plunder. This country has gone to the dogs. To the point he can brazenly claim on live tv that 2 billion disappears everyday. Can you imagine? You wake up everyday at 6am. Enter a shitty matatu that is unroadworthy, go to the unsafest part of Nairobi, CBD. If you survive pickpockets on your way to the stage, big up yourself. You go work at a shitty office with a shitty boss and earn a shitty salary. Then go back to CBD, walk like you‚Äôre in a walk race so as not to attract muggers then you finally get home. 
At the end of the day, 30% is taken from your hard earned money so you can get ‚Äúservices‚Äù. 
Our roads are shitty, our healthcare system is non existent among other terrible things. 


I tell my family these things but they‚Äôre ‚Äúuthamakis‚Äù. They do not see it as the premier‚Äôs fault. They think he just hired the wrong people. Lol 
They call me brainwashed by my Nairobi friends. Because I speak against him. They say if Uhuru says jump they ask how high. I‚Äôm always angry at family gatherings because I‚Äôm very political. And I find it hard to keep shit to myself. Wish we could unlearn tribal politics by the flick of a wrist. But alas. We have a long way to go.

uuhpzl,Kenya,1653116320.0,"So, this is just my own opinion from my own perspective and experience. 

Do not have a wedding that you cannot afford! About six years ago at the ripe age of 27, my college sweetheart and I decided to tie the knot. She was two years younger than me and from a slightly better off family than mine. 

The total budget for our wedding was ksh 1,118,000 (lumping in dowry and the wedding. I paid 200k for dowry, so wedding was about 918,000). I also raised 400,000 from savings (my entire savings actually), took a loan of 300,000 and received 300,000 from the contributions of family (mostly hers) and friends. 

I won't go into so many details, but paying off that 300k while also handling domestic financial responsibilities took a major toll on me. I no longer had any money for leisure or my personal projects. This in turn took a strain on the marriage and we divorced 3 years ago, we have one child with whom we share custody and I feel like I let him down the most in all of this. I won't blame just the wedding for the failure of our marriage as there were many other factors and issues with compatibility involved, but the cost and subsequent debt contributed heavily to the failure of this marriage.

As an old-ish buck to a young one, you have nothing to prove to anybody. You don't need to have a big expensive wedding and never take on debt to have a wedding. Have a ceremony within your means and ensure your financial freedom. Learn from my mistakes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/uuhpzl/weddings/,Weddings,,133,111,1.0

After 15 months of playing a Master distiller in my crib (undisclosed location) thanks to covid lockdown I have managed to craft four types of alcoholic drinks courtesy of this powerful traditional plant called MURATINA harvested from the slopes of Kieni, Nyeri County 

introducing The Muratina Family, the finest traditional drink using today's science and technology 

1. **Muratina shine/vodka** x3 distilled 40% abv 
2. **Muratina Oak** 40% abv (rested in oak barrel for 8 weeks )
3. **Muratina original** 8% abv
4. The first Crafted **Muratina beer** made with Hops, Barley Malt, spring water, and Muratina herb 4.7% abv kegged and refrigerated to keep it fresh, crispy and chilled (my favorite)  

I will be launching Muratina Beer and Muratina original at my friend's wedding in August with an intent to go into full production the legit way

Anyone with a househelp job or any other job that I can do? 

I've finished form four and I've done a beauty course.

I've also been a waitress for 1 year until Corona came and I lost my job. I then did a househelp job for 3 months at a friends house.

I'm flexible and I can do whatever job within reasonable dignity limits (sorry can't do sponsors, prostitution, etc).

I've lived as an orphan all my life, growing up in Rehema Pefa home and had to move out when I turned 20yrs. Not looking for handouts (even though I'd never turn away help), but I believe in getting an opportunity to fish as opposed to endlessly receiving fish.

Currently living with a friend and even though she's not complaining, I feel bad being a burden to her. Would like to move out but I have nowhere to go - no siblings or relatives to host me.

I'm a responsible, hardworking young woman with a rock-solid work ethic.

I remember being convinced to endure the relaxer heat on my scalp to achieve this bone straight hair so that I can manage my hair, but had to cut it later coz it was falling out in some places. Did it really become manageable or more stressful? Boys and men barely have hair too, more than 2cm is too much yet everyone else has more than 5 inches of hair. We can't complain though... apparently its an unspoken rule that you follow or leave. Do you want to stay in school? Do you want a job? Do you want to be well-groomed? Then get rid of your African hair!

1) The pickpocketer, yani pinji/mtu wa kusanya, the guy in possession of your property will quickly go to your control panel & put your phone in Airplane-mode then he will shut down your IPhone. Wewe utastruggle hapo kucall simu yako lakini wapi...

2) Mr Pickpocketer/Mr Pinji/ Mr Msanyanji, will now do everything in his power to get as far away from the vicinity as possible, usually as far as the next County...

3) The following day, after sleeping off his fantamargogeous Heist, Mr. Pickpocketer will quickly find a Brocker & sell them the  phone at a stupidly cheap price, usually at around 1000 kshs. why? because stealing iphones is 1 thing but Overriding the ICLOUD LOCK is another, An Iphone with an ICLOUD LOCK is like carrying around an expensive brick. Very useless to Mr. Pickpocketer.

4) Now the phone is in the hands of  Mr. Brocker, These brockers are usually people who own stores that sell refurbished IPhones pale CBD or employees of such stores. Now Mr. Brocker, since he is a business man he needs to make back the 1000shs he spent on buying your IPhone from Mr. Pickpocketer right? He Has 2 options. 1) Sell the Parts of the IPhone abroad usually in Asia, price is roughly 50 - 100$. 2) Try & Get your Apple ID & Password in order to override The ICOLUD LOCK & then sell the IPhone at Retail price of 1300$ and make 100% profit.

5) Mr Broker will usually opt for option number 2, lazima wapate maximum returns just like any other business man. This is where the PHISHING EXPEDITION starts. 

6) Mr. Brocker will usually wait roughly 2 months before kicking off the PHISHING EXPEDITION. because at this time, unakuanga ushaa kubali simu imeenda hivo & most IPhone owners will put the phone in Lost Mode. Lost Mode is when you LOG into FindMyIphone in another device & put the lost phone in LOSTMODE which usually locks the phone further and displays a message on the screen saying 'This Iphone Is Lost Please Contact This number' 

7) Now step 1 of the Phishing Expedition involves Mr.Brocker going to a very remote area of the country where he will turn on the IPhone in order to see the LOSTMODE screen so that he can get your contact information. he will then switch the phone off and leave the remote area because the location of your Iphone will have been pinged on FINDMYIPHONE.

8) After he has gotten your contact info, ataenda kwa bedsitter yake pale Thika and that's when the number that you put in LOSTMODE will start receiving messages from 'Apple' claiming that your iphone 14 PRO MAX 512 GB GOLD has been located & you need to click this 'link' in order to view the location. Most Kenyans are gullible and they will click this link, the link will require you  to put in your Apple ID & Password & BOOM! that's how you loose your IPhone FOREVER.

9) Wewe ukiwa katika harakati za kuweka password yako in order to 'Locate' your Lost IPhone, Mr. Broker is on the same terminal on another device watching everything you're doing & after he gets your Apple ID & Password, he will reset your IPhone, take it to his shop & sell it as a new phone & make good money.

10) Alafu he proceeds to the next patient....",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/z3fpmy/this_is_the_journey_your_iphone_goes_through/,THIS IS THE JOURNEY YOUR IPHONE GOES THROUGH AFTER IT IS STOLEN,Science & Technology,123,82,0.99

Stop dating broke women.Your work is to send 2k, nitumie 500. Whatever you give should never be asked for, it should be an addition to what I have.

Many men seem to think it's ok to get into dept to impress a broke lady. I know he won't leave her but meen, naonea kijana huruma. Yeye si babake

v4k4dl,Kenya,1654329394.0,"Let me explain. Global loneliness rates among young people us going up. This is especially true for men, who have a harder time than women forming communities. Locally, Covid made things worse and the economy makes things worser. Bc now we can go out and engage in fun activities and partake in hobbies but we don't have the money.So we stay in, buy bundles and watch movies, maybe log into whatsapp once in a while.

Now,one can realistically have multiple friends but only one girlfriend  (for the most part). So, it doesn't make sense that every woman they meet they instantly hit on? Statistically, does it not make sense to offer friendship up first, and if it organically blossoms into something romantic, good for you, and if it doesn't, you still have a friend in your repertoire?

Because you could hit on someone and if they are not interested you have lost yourself a  potential friend and maybe future partner both in one fell swoop.

Maybe I'm just frustrated because in one week, one man started sending intimate texts within 3 days of meeting, another solicited sex within an hour of inviting himself over and making poor one sided conversation and yet another made a good conversation awkward with innuendos when we both know I've seen his SO bring him food multiple times.

There's something expensive we lose, especially in today's world, when you sheer bonds prematurely by introducing sexual/romantic subtext. Bc now, though we share interests, i no longer feel comfortable in these men's presence and they won't meet my eyes in the corridors any longer. And for what?

That 30 minute sex you think you want with an essential stranger won't fill the void. I know it, idk how y'all don't. And, as per multiple studies, sex is better with someone you know too, so y'all aren't even being devious enough to play the long game smh.

A few recent example: 

Was on a bus to Nairobi and a guy opened the window the whole way. I could see everybody was uncomfortable with the cold but no one said a thing. People wore extra clothes. He like opened it the whole way and wind was literally coming into our bus. 

Another time while waiting for ID, a lady was there vomiting profusely and was very sick. Nobody even spoke to her. She had to take herself to the hospital alone. 

Another time while opening an account at equity, the bank teller kept shouting at us. We were like 25 adults. Nobody said a thing. And we didn't do anything. For hours while waiting.

Some other time an Asian guy was insulting us at Naivas supermarket in broken English while waiting on line. Nobody said a thing. Even the watchmen. He apparently didn't want anyone close to him. 

Am not racist but can you imagine if I was in a Chinese supermarket demanding the locals don't come near me.

There are myths and facts about fuel saving but most drivers dwell on myths more than facts.

Here are simple steps that any driver can follow and end up saving fuel by 85%.

-Before you start your engine, make sure you check on your engine oil and coolant levels.

-Start your car engine let it run for atleast 30 seconds to allow oil to circulate.

-As it runs check on the tyre pressure and make sure they are good.

-After the 30 seconds switch off  your car engine.

-Lock the doors, and walk to work.

-Repeat this every day until you have enough money for fuel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/pp3k9k/how_to_save_your_fuel_by_85_when_you_dont_have/,HOW TO SAVE YOUR FUEL BY 85% WHEN YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY,Humour,114,27,0.97

Over the past 4 months i've been working on building a small tool to track my previous KPLC electricity transactions. Felt that the current self service portal really wasn't sufficient to do the same.   
So i built [stima.app](https://stima.app) that does a subjectively better job in showing giving you more info on your prepaid / postpaid transactions.  
For more on the how the core part of the platform works check out [this blog post](https://davidamunga.com/blog/b1ba269b-8b37-4203-b85a-e917ae47a495)  
The app is free forever and was built as a hobby educational project with no intended commercial use in plan. Only Subscription data (name ,email , meterNo) optionally provided by the user is stored for the purpose of sending a monthly roundup email. All queries made to get past transactions are not cached in a database. You can check out more on how it was built in a recent [blog post](https://davidamunga.com/blog/0a3dee5b-de91-49a8-84c4-7f2cb0faca6c).

If keeping track of your past bills resonates with you, then give stima app a try :)

xeknp5,Kenya,1663208968.0,"Hi guys. My neighbour's maid knocked at my door yesterday so hard I thought the building was burning.
She asked me if we have a smart tv to which I replied no. She ran away only to come back a few minutes later. She asked me to help her with their tv. 

I went there reluctantly because her boss is a very rude and mean woman. She wasn't there. She gave me the remote and asked me to delete the tv search history on YouTube. I was curious to know why. 

I was shocked to find that she had searched:

Sexy sexy,  
Phonography,. 
Man and woman sexy sexy,. 
Indian sexy sexy. 

I think she was trying to search for porn and I felt extremely awkward. She tried to explain to me that the children sometimes search for ""bad things"" .

I told her that the children are too young to do that. She said that sometimes the tv acts up and she doesn't know how it happened. Anyway I tried and after sometime I delete all the search history. 

Then she told me she had a problem with her neon ray. I could tell it was new. She asked me to ""wipe everything"" on the phone. I said ok and wanted to reset the phone. After confirming if she knew the email and password, she brought a paper where the information was written. I figured that maybe she wanted to delete her search history on chrome and YouTube. 

I was curious and looked at what she had searched and saw the same theme. She was trying to look for xxx videos without success. The farthest she has ever gone is those clickbait romantic videos on YouTube. Like how bad can someone be at looking up porn on the internet. They are literally billions of such videos üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

Anyway I cleared her search history on YouTube and chrome and gave her back the phone. She took some time looking at the phone. I am assuming she was looking at the history and after a minute I saw her smiling. She asked me how I was able to get her contacts back if I wiped everything on the phone. I bragged that I know such staff.

I didn't reset the phone because with neon rays you can only use the email registered after the phone was bought. Also the email password she gave me was incorrect. I couldn't go into recovering the password at that moment. 

Anyway I feel bad for her. I have a lot of porn in my phone. Should I just ask to send her some. She could lose her job if her employer sees the search history on YouTube in the tv.

He said he would place my IUD on my arm(i don't want it on my arm) and not anywhere else. That doctor charges 2000 for a consultation and i waited 3 hours for him, he also comes highly recommended. Imagine i skipped all of my morning classes to go to this doctor. 

Lesson that i learned never go to a male gynecologists.  When did doctors start lecturing women about their hypothetical husbands and virginity.

sdtb26,Kenya,1643270499.0,"Yeah, the title's correct.
I met this nice lady around this time last year. A few conversations and we were soon in a relationship. From our talks back then, one thing I liked about her was her ambition, her drive. Yaani she knew what she wanted in life and was specific about it. Fast forward to about four months ago, she moved in with one of her friends who has a 'loaded' boyfriend. I don't know exactly what they talked but soon later we had a conversation where she told me her friends wonder about her boyfriend because he doesn't spend on her and that means he's spending elsewhere,huh! That hit me hard btw.
Concurrently, she started being distance. Our daily talks started going cold. We'd talk daily and it was fuuun, then it started being a two minute call, just small talk. ""how was your day, blah blah blah"". I soon founded a startup and started getting some more cash flow, I started sending some salon money, coz you know, you gotta take care of your girl, mmnh.

I took a day to look back and the change all started when her friend/friends put the idea that her boyfriend should take care of her needs. She has a job btw, and far from the capital. She would become 'loving' around when I send her money and then go back. She'd then always find excuses to avoid meeting me.

Long story short, it all started to revolve around money and I don't think my job as a boyfriend is to be the financer of my girl. I'm okay with a little now and then but ikikua inafanya you despise me, it's not good. Red flag üö©


Kesho niko single. A birthday to remember


EDIT: It happened:

I'd asked her to call me and I was to tell her what's on my mind, but she ended up hanging up on me after telling her how she's indecisive on what she wants out of the relationship. That was the last thing we talked about. I met her after attending a cousin's event and this cousin knew about our relationship, so when she'd asked a while ago, I was unable to hide it from her. She's married and really good at giving advice but this made her really sick. So she posted a pic of me on her WhatsApp status and this drove her nuts.

Anyway, I believe breakups over text are not alright but I had to do it that way, she hung u already. She later talked to a mutual friend, admitted we had problems, but couldn't say them to him. Asking whether we tried to solve them, she couldn't answer too. I've tried to meet my former gf like three times a week and I couldn't. Not something someone who loves you would do. 
This thing that I thought I'd do and get over with turns out it's deep guys. I feel a gaping hole bana. I mean I'd planned to do this, yes, but still, there's something that's gone. Dunno how long it's gonna take to get over it but I got hope that it's gonna be soon.
Well, it was a day with mixed feelings. Happy for turning a year, yet another chapter closed. Life, right?

I appreciate all the good messages... and I'm a bit sad that this trend is rampant out here. I hope we all get people who reciprocate our vibe, really.

I worked with some of them in some INGO and I hated every moment of it.

Majority of Americans are poor. Living paycheck to paycheck while working multiple jobs. The movies are fictional. In reality you will see homeless people everywhere, hear gun shots on a regular basis, and deal with rude people on a daily. You need to make over $100,000 to make a decent living here, and that can and most likely will take a decade. The average pay in Humble City is $40000(after taxes $31000). Rent over a year will be $12000, insurance on a vehicle $120+ a month, car payment $400, food $600 a month. Not including health insurance etc. you will be left with $100. Unless you live with family! If you live in a big city expect to work 2-3 part time/full time jobs. 

If you do come here, the best option is to work 3-5 years on a semi-truck, save 60% or more of your salary and come back to Kenya, even if that means living in the truck.

1108yni,Kenya,1676183063.0,"r/Kenya just crossed 93k subscribers today. The growth has been unprecedented, there was a time we had only 30k subs while r/Nigeria had 70k and we have officially passed them in subscriber count. 

If you look at subreddits such as r/SouthAfrica, their subscriber count is larger but the engagement with posts is lower compared to r/Kenya. It seems that the recent passing of AKA has been talked about more on r/Kenya than on r/SouthAfrica. 

Why does r/Kenya do so well? 3 words; Variety of Topics. 

People here can post about Kenya‚Äôs beauty, relationships, their career struggles, an addiction they‚Äôre battling, politics, travel etc. 

Another thing is getting advice here is super easy. Posts here get multiple comments in less than 10mins. 

It‚Äôs one thing to get advice from another subreddit from someone in America, but a fellow Kenyan will have more context and might be able to give better advice on relationships, addiction, vacation, family etc. 

Also people can have discussions and have their views challenged about various topics. I for one have changed my opinions on certain issues after other Redditors challenged my thinking. This is what makes r/Kenya vibrant.

Take a look at r/southafrica, no offense to them but 80% of their posts is pictures of the country, their electricity issues and ANC. I wouldn‚Äôt subscribe there to be honest. 

r/Kenya is like a multitude of subreddits of various topics in one, but with a Kenyan touch. I believe soon we will pass r/southafrica. 

Mods, please don‚Äôt force r/Kenya to turn into one of those subreddits where people only post pictures of giraffes and lions. Allow various topics to be shared and opinions to be challenged (of course this must be done respectfully, politely and in good faith)

m75lic,Kenya,1616001907.0,"1. Many boarding high schools operate within strict schedules.. The one I was in was no different.. We jad lessons from 5AM to 8:50PM and then go to sleep at 10PM.. Ka uko form four ni 11PM... All these hours spent on convering 8subjects... Honestly, this is poor time manage.. In countries like US where students can take waay advanced classes and even college credit, they dont have as hard time as kenyan students do.. And yet.. After all the hours soent burried in ‚Äòbooks‚Äô.. Most high school gradutes, if not all, dont end up developing essential skills needed to compete in the real world.

2. COMPUTER STUDIES IS THE MOST WASTEFUL SUBJECT EVER IN HS.. Ata heri ufanye bizna ama kitu ka hio.. Why?.. A high school student who takes computer studies for all four years of high school, will graduate without knowing anything about CODING.. we have reached the point where its very essential for someone to know coding.. Programming is a really essential part of tech( the most essential if I may say).. Na bado a whole HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM doesnt have anything about programming.. Mnafunzwa binary code tu... THIS CRIPPLES KENYAN STUDENTS.. Because globally, many high school students know how to code by the time they graduate high school.. Do you know how weird it is to say you did computer studies during your whole high school period and yet have no experience in programming.. If that is not a huge indicator of how kenyan students are being wasted by the system.. I dont know what is..


3. LACK OF SEX EDUCATION.. Like the only oart where sex is basically taught is in biology form three.. Of which , students aren‚Äôt really taught about how to use condoms or about different kinds of birth control with their risks and benefifs.. Watoto hawafunzwi what to do when sexual assault happens or even how to take care of their genitalia.. Like honestly with soending more of your life in school, you‚Äôd think yhe education system would care enough but wueehh..


4. THE PLAIN DISREGARD OF STUDENTS‚Äô MENTAL HEALTH.. Honestly, ka ulisurvive 844... Mseh congrats to you.. Its hard.. With the abusive teachers and the hel toxic environment... Huko shule ukimention ati depression.. Unaonekana ka rich kid ama mseh akona maringo.. Yet depression is a huge problem that affects a number of hugh school students.. Why are schools so ignorant?


5. THE LACK OF CAREER GUIDANCE AND ADVISING... Honestly, only rich kids have the chance to get career guidance facilities.. Otherwise.. Inakuanga the same old same old.. Ukipata A - med ama engineering.. Otherwise, ni wer na Mungu wako na pesa za wazazi wako.. THIS IS WRONG.. very wrong.. Not every A student wants yo do medicine.. Kwanza hii narrative ya ati Med ni ya A students is very very toxic... Pia, kuna soo many other options that ate left unsaid and hence.. Everyone ends up choosing the same fee courses na ka hauna the grades or the money.. Unatipiliwa na system..



6.The 844 system only benefits the wealthy and the ‚Äòbright students‚Äô.. If you dont fall into any, ur pretty much done.. Sadly.. eg.. In a very popular local public uni.. Unapata course ka CS .. Ikona ~46 govt sponsored students ( who got A and A-) alafu around 80 parallel students.. This shows that more space is reserved for those who can afford to pay.. Same for med and the rest..


Is this right?

Lets not forget to mention the lack of talent development happening in schools... Like so much talent gets wasted in 844 schools

kt4ciz,Kenya,1610118774.0,"**EDIT/DISCLAIMER:  25/03/2020:** I did  not expect this post to gain so much traction until i saw it referenced on several Tweets almost as if it's a guide of some sort. A few people have also reached out to me explaining that they've had a very bad experience with imailKenya.

This post was simply an honest review of my experience with them. It's clear that the  quality of service has since deteriorated. I'll urge all who stumble on this post/review to understand that the post was based on my experience and should not be used as the ultimate source of truth. Many have shared how their packages have been delayed for weeks with no communication or timelines. **I personally will no longer be shipping with them and would advice against using them until or unless you have evidence that the service has improved.**

Rule of thumb is before shipping try to scour the interwebs for the latest reviews on a particular shipping service before using it.

ION: As of today Savostore have revised their terms and have gone back to the Minimum of 1kg ($15) condition.

==

Queries on shipping are some of the most common questions on this sub. I had been shipping for 3 yrs using Savostore until i decided to try something else. Here is my experience:

Savostore was king of shipping until they revised their rates. A Twitter thread by angry Savostore clients that discussed the changes pointed out several alternatives. I randomly picked one to try out: iMail Kenya [https://imailkenya.co.ke/](https://imailkenya.co.ke/)

Since i had never heard of them before i decided to ship an inexpensive item; something i wouldn't bother following up on if it got lost. On 27 Nov, i ordered a book on Amazon worth $54.40, shipping was free, tax was $4.09 (US tax, not Kenyan), total $58.59. I used the shipping address that iMail Kenya provided, you ship to their warehouse in Fargo, North Dakota. My book was delivered to their warehouse on Dec 6. On Dec 9, they acknowledged receipt via SMS, they also took a photo of my package and posted it on my imail Kenya account(they have some sort of ticketing system/platform (freshdesk) that you access by signing up an account with them). On Dec 10, they provided a tracking number that one can use to track a package on their website ([https://imailkenya.co.ke/](https://imailkenya.co.ke/)).

On Dec 13, my package shipped from US. Package arrived in Kenya on 21St Dec and took about a week to clear through customs (remember we had 2 holidays 25/26). It was finally delivered to their warehouse in Eastleigh on 28TH Dec, at this point the package was ready for collection. On 29TH i received an invoice of KES 2984.90. They charge $13.80 per kg. The total weight of my package was 1.9kg.

**Pros compared to other popular shipping companies:**

1. Their website does not have the best design but everything you need is on the homepage. With some shipping companies getting the US address/rates/timelines is a pain, either you register an account or you have to navigate deeper into the site(looking at you Kentex cargo). Their rates are also shown on the homepage, everything you need to know before making up your mind is right there on the homepage and accessible without creating an account, signing up for a newsletter or some other BS.
2. The fact that they take a photo of your package and share it with you is a nice touch. It may look like a cheap gimmick but it helps in overall transparency. In case your package gets lost its unlikely that they'll resort to the popular excuse of ""we did not receive your package""
3. You get to track your package from US to KE. Most shipping agents don't provide this service.
4. Timelines are close to what is advertised (within two weeks), note that this is from the date of shipment to KE, not from the date they receive your package. Since they ship on Mondays (with a cutoff time of Sunday), if they receive your package on Monday, it will remain on hold until the next shipping date (next Monday) meaning it will now take upto 3 weeks for package to get to Kenya.
5. No hidden charges.

**CONS.**

1. Even though they respond to emails and Whatsapp i found their communication to be a bit disjointed. They have working emails and Whatsapp but on some occasions when you message them they respond by saying they'll relay your message to ""the Kenyan team"" yet the whatsapp number is Kenyan and the email is .co.ke. They need to synchronize communication between their US and Kenya teams to cut down on the loops one has to go through before getting the desired response.
2. Once your package arrives in Kenya they are slow at organizing last mile delivery by local courier to your destination. They are also not eager to communicate next steps (something that Savostore was good at). I figured that since i had paid all the fees, they had nothing to gain from me and my package was no longer a priority. I understand the Kenyan business culture where once umelipa kila kitu you are on your own; all communication, follow up and customer service stops. Even though i had indicated the need to have the package shipped to my place by G4S no response was forthcoming. I eventually had to go and pick the package from their warehouse in Eastleigh.

**Will i use them again?**

YES. Another order is already on the way.

**Any tips.**

1. Always try and take advantage of economies of scale. Shipping a $9 item makes no sense when the shipping fee is $13.80. If you have smaller purchases try and consolidate them into one.

 At the age of 10 i decided that i will be different, this is after i won a baking competition and my uncle told me that i should keep learning to bake so as to please my future husband. I never baked again till recently at the age of 22.

My parents left Somalia and sarted from scratch in kenya. I was lucky that i was never born in Somalia because life there is crazy from what i hear, i finished high school went to university and graduated started my bachelor's,  bought my first land , became the first woman in my family who did not get pregnant at the age of 17, the first woman who graduated from uni. I did it all whilst taking care of my mothers six children plus her oldest son my father.

My mother sat me down yesterday and said that there was a marriage proposal for me, from a man in America he is also Somali, he is 34 and has one foot in the grave, a truck driver but just because he has an American passport he is a hot commodity in the marriage market, i politely declined and it begun when am i planning to get married? never, don't you want kids?no, are you going to be a virgin for the rest of your life? yes. 

Long story short my mother has given me 2 years to find a man or she will do it for me. I don't want to be a typical Somali woman, who has 10 kids and stays at home, complines about her husband while he impregnates teenagers in Somalia in the name of Islam.

 Alot of people in my family don't seem to understand my uncle looked at me and said ""just because you have an education you think you are better than everyone"". He told my mother that she did me a disservice by educating me. Oh and my cousin called me a lesbian that is how i started my 2023, i am not becoming like my mother or aunties just because they suffered doesn't mean everyone should suffer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/10ypxt7/breaking_generational_curse/,Breaking Generational Curse,Culture & Religion ,99,75,0.98

rv5mle,Kenya,1641227396.0,"Do you enjoy browsing on an empty sub?

The reason you're seeing what you think should be in other subs like r/relationships is because people want views, advice that relate to how it happens in Kenya. People want it in a Kenyan perspective. 

Like the experience of online dating (tinder etc) in Kenya is different from the one in Norway or developed countries. If you describe a problem people over there can't relate or they will give you an advice that doesn't work in Kenya.

It would have been better if r/Kenya could have been divided into sections but that's not possible. So all the posts about Kenyan politics, sports, dating, social relations, education, jobs, careers etc are in one place.

A sub about Kenya doesn't mean it's about the geographical features of Kenya or description of Kenya, or tourism or politics. It's about everything Kenya, how life is in Kenya, dating, politics, etc... everything. 

So those who think a post is irrelevant, just skip it",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/rv5mle/what_is_it_with_some_people_complaining_with_the/,What is it with some people complaining with the content on r/Kenya?,,99,25,0.92

rwnid8,Kenya,1641391126.0,"It all started in a case I heard happened at an Indian international school tht offered IGCSE. My friend who came from that school told me tht if you were indian you would get free extra classes and credit to help you with your grades, but if you were African that would not be the case.

 I used to have an Indian friend. One time I went to visit her and I think her mom had come over. She opened the door and was shocked to See Me. She told me she had a guest, who was her mom and that I should never come to her place whenever she had visitors. (most of the people who visited her were her family who were all Indian).

 And my cousin told me about a neighborhood that was made for Indians and them alone. They even have a school there so that they don't have their children to mix with Africans. 

I personally when I went house hunting with my mom. We came across a beautiful neighborhood. The soldier at the gate told us there was an empty house but said that we shouldn't live there because the Indians there did not accept Africans. And I think a majority of the neighborhood were Indian. It was a small neighborhood.

I'm not talking about all Indians since I also know some of them who are very nice. I just wonder, why come to a place like Kenya and refuse to even let your children mix with African Kenyans or just African people? If you have a problem with us then don't come here.

My parents also taught me about Indians caste system. And it seem from what I was told they view is like a lower caste just because your skin has melanine.

n64m8i,Kenya,1620298685.0," \#1. Don't go downtown if you don't have to. 

\#2. If you move into a new house, use two padlocks no matter how good quality they are. #3. Ukitembea tao uskie mtu amesema 

 \#4. When boarding a mat, check the condition of your window..that's where your phone might exit from. 

\#5. No one should pray for you on the streets regardless of your situation in life.

\#6. Chapati will always be 10bob, Smokie 25bob, mayai 20bob. 

 \#7. Afya Center..don't even stop to swallow your saliva, pita ukikimbia. Walk mercilessly! And if you have hips,use them to pave way for yourself! . Elbows pia ni weapons... Unapita ukienda bila kuangalia nyuma. 

If someone hits you as you walk along the streets,hit them back because no one apologizes for such mistakes in this city!! 

\#8. If you feel lost just go to the Archives, you will pick your bearing from there. 

 \#9. In case someone drops anything Infront of you, don't pick!!  Run like your life depends on it. Hata ukiitwa siste siste ,achana nayo. 

\#10. Instead of going to kanjo washrooms, just get into Ushirika house, tell the guards you are going to office 24.  It is actually a washroom labeled by mistake or if you're pressed, ingia Hilton, Stanley, Norwich etc...confidence is key here....kuna free parking Serena...play like yourself 

 \#11. Wakati wa mvua usinyeshewe  kama mimea hapo kwa corridors, get in supermarkets watch the news from 85"" Samsung screen. Fanya window shopping hata Kama hununui kitu....confidence ndio muhimu 

 \# 12 Don't bargain on everything...the trick is the quality will keep reducing as the price goes down 

  \#13.Avoid eye contact na hawker especially ukiwa traffic jam otherwise you already signed a purchase contract 

 \#14 When tired under scorching sun in town, don't go to archives or Hilton. Just go to KCB Kencom,pick a bank ticket and sit there the whole day .You will have great rest 

\#15.whatever you buy must be packaged in front of you yaani mbele yako or you will  find yourself with avocado seeds instead of potatoes.Never buy shoes at night 

\#16.In case uone any job openings ikona phrase ""send  WhatsApp with the  word Nairobi"" to a certain number jua ni wale watu wa global. Any job utaitishwa dooh uambiwe itakuwa refunded,hio ni *wash wash* 

 \#17.Ukiskia risasi anywhere close to you,don't run....duck to the nearest shop...if you run watu wa kwenu wataambiwa uliuliwa na stray bullet...

 \#18.Ukiingia kwa matatu and the window next to you haijifungi ama iko faulty, assume hauna simu the moment you remove it its gone...Never walk in a straight line...walk like 2 minutes then change direction abruptly...the main aim is to be unpredictable 

 \#19.Don't talk to those old grandmas in the streets even thieves grow old

 \#20.Leave your Christian virtues and fruits of the holy spirit at your home doormat.Think like a con and treat everyone like a suspect otherwise you'll get fixed

t5xspc,Kenya,1646331062.0,"Like 3 months ago, my boyfriend and I walk into a public hospital, to be specific, Gatundu level 5 in Kiambu county. First, I am from the Rift and my significant other is from the Lakeside. Like any other hospital you fill up a form and stuff and you wait for your turn to see the doc. There were so many people in line and so we knew it would take a while, but not too long. We decided to go to Gatundu Level 5 cause it was the closest hospital  to our location. So we are sitting down wondering why my bf is not being called after waiting for hours, yet people  who got there after us are seeing the doctor. So I  ask one of the nurses ""what is going on',and the rude nurse tells me to  just wait for our turn.. Meanwhile people who came after us are being called. So some guy noticed we were not from the area, he's from western. He told us outright, if you are not 'Kikuyu' you won't be given a priority, he  is from western. He went on to tell us his ordeal, apparently he'd come in at 8 in the morning and by the time he was done with everything tests and all, it was 8 p.m in the evening. I told my bf let's just leave there is nothing here for us to wait. If this is how healthare works in public hospitals, then I can say for a fact that many people have died in hospitals because they were considered 'foreigners'. .Imagine how much of a mess healthcare is in Kenya, and  to top  it all with Tribalism, aargh man its a tragedy out here..The way tribalism is entrenched in Kenyan society makes me throw up. I mentioned I am from the Rift Valley, and when it comes to tribalism my people take the trophy, 100%, they are the absolute worst. Back in campus I saw my friends get denied campus services because their names didn't have a 'kip' or 'chep', sickening innit..I'll talk about this one, some other day...It's so disheartening that your surname is the defining factor of whether a doctor will attend to you, whether you'll get a job, get a government service etc..aargh makes me livid....Like y'all need to intermarry man and get rid of this 'My People', B.S mentality..Sad, Sickening and Downright Ugly!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/t5xspc/your_surname_will_literally_betray_you_in_kenya/,Your Surname will Literally Betray you in Kenya,,93,80,0.97

ikmuh9,Kenya,1598975675.0,"Nowadays, doing business in Kenya is akin to trying to get blood from a stone. Its punitive, discouraging and downright robbery courtesy of the government of Kenya. 

For example, if you are interested in setting up  a water ""Refill and Packing Station""........ these are the licences and taxes that you need to cough up:

1. County permit = Kshs 18,000.

2. Public Health Licence and Testing = Kshs 13,000. 

3. KEBS certificate = Kshs 102,000.

4. KRA Licence = Ksh 50,000.

5. KRA Custom Excise Stamp = Kshs 50,000. 

6. NEMA License =Kshs 33,000.

7.Mandatory MOU =Kshs 15,000. 

8. There is 0.5% of Monthly turnover Stardards Level tax.

9. Ksh 5.47 excise for every litre of water sold.

10. Each county requires you to have a distribution license that is charged annually. If you sell water in 5 counties you have to obtain licenses from each county, which can be upto Kshs 50,000 in some counties. 

Fellow Sufferers, 
Our President loves to lie that small businesses is the backbone of the economy....then the youths swallow that stupid lie and run for loans like ""Stawi Youth Fund"" in order to start biashara....but at what cost? 

The problems that we have as a people, especially the youths, is that we are so much blinded by politics rather than articulate on policy change.
We need to have an overhaul policy change on how Kenyans can do business in their own country If we are to succeed as a country. 

For far too long, we have surrendered these kind of issues to politicians...but clearly, we are on our own! So people, don't be too shocked. 

Still on this issue of refilling water and packaging, lets say you do delivery...your nduthi rider wanting to deliver your products in the CBD will also need 15,000 shillings for branding of the delivery box hapo nyuma ya nduthi.
You will also need to cough up 12,000 shillings za parking fee payable in 4 months, but the best that majority of you can do is praise Uhuru for laying cabro in CBD, instead of fighting for a breathing space when it comes to the cost of doing business! 

However, deni ya China must be paid. 
Devolution must run as provided by the law.
Soon you will pay $1000 per month to retired members of parliament.
You must cough up money to pay more than 300 MPs per month. 
You are the same people agitating so loudly that we need to have more women in parliament inorder to meet the threshold of the gender rule. I always ask, mtawalipa na nini? Izo pesa zitatoka wapi? Well, wewe piga kelele utafutie watu wengine kazi...ilhali wewe unangandamizwa to a point that you can't even afford to start a business!
You are the same people saying we expand the executive......ehe....are you ready to pay the ultimate price of servicing the lifestyles of the Prime Minister and his or her deputies?
Lastly, there must be billions of funds for corrupt government officials to steal.

KRA is working tirelessly to ensure the government meets its targets. You think it's to benefit you? Under Kibaki, the slogan ""kulipa ushuru ni kujitegemea"" made sense and it even evoked a sense of patriotism. Today, KRA is on our necks so that it can get money to satisfy the lifestyle of our political class! 
Our politicians have vested interest in this status quo of seeing Kenyans become poor kila uchao. 
This is the money that finances all those shenanigans we hear of hefty salaries, allowances, fuel guzzlers and other perks.

Fellow Sufferers, 
It's clear that doing a legit business in Kenya is the hardest thing to do.
I understand this is why you start a business, and whoever lands on you...you talk with them (bribe) and move on. This is how the majority of Kenyans have managed to survive in this country.
In Kenya, the system has been designed in a way that you cannot start a business without bribing a government official. 
We got taxes hitting the roof, yet there are no policies to defend or support start ups.

Fellow Sufferers,
It's hard to be patriotic in this country. 
You have to be either a thief or a criminal to survive the Jubilee Era.

This country's business regulation and taxation is a complete disaster. It is very ambiguous, exhausting, ineffective and expensive......and this is a big burden for small businesses, and that's why many fail.

In this country, many know that kufungua kazi in Kenya ndio kazi.
It's now slowly hitting home why big companies like Nike cannot afford to operate a business in Kenya.
I have travelled extensively, and many business people out there wonder how we survive in Kenya.

This is the same country that we want our youths to start their own business? How?  

The President and his cabinet are busy telling the youths to create jobs....yet they are sitting pretty in their offices overseeing the crudest system designed against the youths, and to a large extent, the people of Kenya, when it comes to starting a business. 

As a people, we know that in most cases the amount of money required by the government when starting a business tends to be more than your capital. It leaves you wondering whether you are investing in government or in your dream. 
Mr President, this nonsense needs to stop! 

The government must know that unnecessary regulations and requirements are ruining SMES in Kenya.
It can't be that before you start saving for business capital, you must first save more than your required capital for licences only! No....this shouldn't be the case! 

I know of someone who wanted to start a small kinyozi,but the licences topped to 15,000 shillings! To the oligarchs, and the politicians, this amount is pittance to them, but to a Kenyan youth, this is quite alot of money!

I've come to realize that in Kenya, it isn't that there are no business opportunities for the youths to invest in....no...it's the demands required before one starts the business that limit our young people. 
This is why you find that the only easy business left for our youths to conduct ni biashara ya kuuza mtumba na ku'ride nduthi!  Wale wameomoka kiasi wakijaribu kufanya biashara zingine, huwa wanajipata wamepigwa knockout na hizo ma licenses! 

It's a shame that the government, be it county or national, has failed in providing clean and safe drinking water to the citizens...and now they are making it hard for entrepreneurs to fill in the gap where they have failed. 

To top it all up, you sit down and wait to watch or read about scandals left right and centre...and the attempted cover up, coupled up with empty rhetoric from the President! 

Fellow Sufferers, 
Please know this, the government has a lot of money..and that's why people are looting mercilessly!

I believe that ordinary Kenyans are intentionally frustrated by the government so that they can NEVER start their own businesses. The end goal is that they must remain poor and work for peanuts in companies belonging to politicians, ama kampuni za wahindi. 

The creation of employment will forever remain a mirage in this nation.

hq7hab,Kenya,1594608854.0,"  

Someone posted on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/hms9dv/forex_trading/) a few days ago asking about forex and forex trading in Kenya, I have gone through the responses and clearly, most people don‚Äôt have an idea. It is 3am in the morning and am in a good mood so let me make this post. This will be a comprehensive and lengthy post so grab a pen and paper and sit down. We‚Äôll be here a while.

**FIRST OF ALL, who am I..?** 

I am a forex trader, in Nairobi, Kenya..i have been actively involved in forex since I found out about it in Feb 2016 when I somehow ended up in a wealth creation seminar (lol) in pride inn Westlands, the one close to Mpaka Rd. Luckily for me, it was not one of those AIM global meetings or I‚Äôd be on Facebook selling God knows what those guys sell. I did not take it seriously till August of the same year and I have been active ever since. 

I don‚Äôt teach, mentor or sell a course or signals, I trade my own money. I am also posting from a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt want KRA on my ass.

**What the fuck is forex and forex trading.**

In simple plain English, forex is like the stock market but for currencies. Stock Market = Shares, forex = currencies. If you want more in-depth explanation, google is your friend. 

These currencies are pegged on specific countries, united states- dollar, UK- pound, euro zone- euro, Switzerland- Swiss franc, Kenya- Kenya shilling.. you get the point. Now, there are specific events and happenings between these economies that affect the movement and values of the currencies, driving their value (purchasing power up and down). Forex trading exploits these movements to make money. When the value is going up, we buy and vice versa (down ‚Äìsell)

**Is forex trading illegal in Kenya? Is it a scam?**

Illegal, no. scam, no. All the banks in the world do it (KCB made about 4 billion from trading forex in 2019)

**Have there been scams involving forex in Kenya?**

 Yes. [Here](https://www.nation.co.ke/kenya/news/suspect-in-forex-trade-scam-faces-extradition-from-us-733816) is one that happened recently. This one is [the most infamous one yet.](https://biznakenya.com/forex-scam/) Best believe that this is not the end of these type of scams because the stupidity, greed and gullibility of human beings is unfathomable.

However, by the end of this post, I hope you won‚Äôt fall for such silliness.

**What next how do I make it work..?**

Am glad you asked. Generally, there are two ways to go about it. One, you teach yourself. This is the equivalent of stealing our dad‚Äôs car and hoping that the pedal you hit is the brake and not the accelerator. It is the route I took, it is the most rewarding and a huge ego boost when you finally make it on your own. Typically, this involves scouring the internet for hours upon hours going down rabbit holes, thinking you have made it telling all your friends how you will be a millionaire then losing all your money. Some people do not have the stomach for that.

The second route is more practical, structured and smarter. 

First Learn the basics. There is a free online forex course at [www.babypips.com/learn/forex](http://www.babypips.com/learn/forex) this is merely an introductory course. Basically it is learning the parts of a car before they let you inside the car.

Second, start building your strategy. By the time you are done with the babypips, you will have a feel of what the forex market is, what interests you, etc. Tip..Babypips has a lot of garbage. It is good for introductory purposes but not good for much else, pick whatever stick to you or jumps at you the first time. Nonsense like indicators should be ignored.

The next step is now the most important. Developing the skill and building your strategy. As a beginner, you want to exhaust your naivety before jumping into the more advanced stuff. Eg can you identify a trend, what is a pair, what is position sizing, what is metatrader 4 and how to operate it, what news is good for a currency, when can I trade, what are the different trading sessions, what is technical analysis, what is market sentiment, what are bullish conditions what is emotion management, how does my psychology affect my trading (more on this later) an I a swing, scalper or day trader etc

**Mentors and forex courses..** you have probably seen people advertising how they can teach and mentor you on how to trade forex and charging so much money for it. Somehow it seems that these people are focused on the teaching than the trading. Weird, right..? Truth is trading is hard, teaching not quite. A common saying in the industry is ‚ÄúThose who can‚Äôt trade, teach‚Äù you want to avoid all these gurus on Facebook and Instagram, some are legit but most are not. Sifting the wheat from the chaff is hard but I did that for you. The info is available online on YouTube, telegram channels etc. am not saying not to spend money on a course, if you find a mentor whose style resonates with you and the course is reasonably priced, please, go ahead and buy..it will cut your learning curve in half. People are different. What worked for me might not work for you.

Here are some nice YouTube channels to watch. These guys are legit..

1. [Sam sieden](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLINoEeF6a43OYA0Y8DBbj7eUQuKnicuFd)

2. [Cuebanks ](https://www.youtube.com/c/CueBanks/videos)

3. [TheCoinFx](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoinFX/videos)

4. [The trading channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheTradingChanneleducate/videos)

5. [Astro](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/youtube.com/c/AstroFx/videos)

6. [Forex family](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZztm1SsfpJvYrx4ok4qYEg/videos)

7. [Wicksdontlie](https://www.youtube.com/c/WicksDontLie/videos)

Advanced stuff

1. [ICT](https://www.youtube.com/c/InnerCircleTrader/videos)

After a short period of time, you will be able to sniff out bs teachers with relative ease. You will also discover some of your own and expand the list. Two tips, start with the oldest videos first and whichever of these resonates with you, stick with till the wheels fall off.

**How long will it take until things start making sense**

Give yourself time to grow and learn. This is all new to you and you are allowed to make mistakes, to fail and discover yourself. Realistically, depending on the effort you put in, you will not start seeing results until after 6 months. Could take longer/shorter so there is no guarantee.

**Social media, Mentality, Psychology and Books** 

Online, forex trading might not have the best reputation online because it takes hard work and scammers and gurus give it a bad name. However, try to not get sucked into the Instagram trader lifestyle as it is nowhere close to what the reality is. You will not make millions tomorrow or the day after, you might never even make it in this market. But that is the reality of life. Nothing is promised, nothing is guaranteed. 

Your **mentality**, beliefs and ego will be challenged in this market. You will learn things that will make you blood boil, you will ask yourself daily, how is this possible, why don‚Äôt they teach this in school..bla bla bla..it will be hard but growth is painful, if it wasn‚Äôt we‚Äôd all be billionaires. Take a break, take a walk, drink a glass of whatever you like or roll one..detox. Chill with your girl (or man) Gradually you will develop mental toughness that will set you up for life. Personally, I sorta ditched religion and picked up stoicism. Whatever works for you.

**Psychology**, this is unfortunately one of the most neglected aspects of your personal development in this journey. Do you believe in yourself? Can you stand by your convictions when everyone is against you? Can you get up every day uncertain of the future? There will be moments where you will question yourself, am I even doing the right thing? the right way? It is normal and essential for your growth. People who played competitive sports have a natural advantage here. Remember the game is first won in your head then on the pitch. 

**Books:** ironically, books that helped me the most were the mindset books, Think and grow rich, trading for a living, 4 hour work week, the monk who sold his Ferrari..just google mindset and psychology books, most trading books are garbage. Watch and listen to people who have made it in the investing business. Ray Dalio, warren, Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn.

This is turning out to be lengthier than I anticipated so I‚Äôll try to be brief for the remaining parts.

**Brokers**

You will need to open up an account with a broker. Get a broker who is regulated. Australian ones (IC Market and Pepperstone) are both legit, reliable and regulated. Do your research. I‚Äôd avoid local ones because I‚Äôve heard stories of wide spreads and liquidity problems. International brokers have never failed me. There are plenty brokers, there is no one size fits all recommendation. If it ain‚Äôt broke..don‚Äôt fix it.

**Money transfer.**

All brokers accept wire transfers, you might need to call your bank to authorize that, avoid Equity bank. Stanchart and Stanbic are alright. Large withdrawals $10k+ you will have to call them prior. Get Skrill and Neteller if you don‚Äôt like banks like me, set up a Bitcoin wallet for faster withdrawals, (Payoneer and Paypal are accepted by some brokers, just check with them.)

**How much money can I make..?**

I hate this question because people have perceived ceilings of income in their minds, eg 1 million ksh is too much to make per month or 10,000ksh is too little. Instead, work backwards. What % return did I make this month/ on this trade. Safaricom made 19.5% last year, if you make 20% you have outperformed them. If you reach of consistency where you can make x% per month on whatever money you have, then there are no limits to how much you can make.

**How much money do I need to start with..?**

Zero. You have all the resources above, go forth. There are brokers who provide free bonuses and withdraw-able profits. However, to make a fulltime income you will need some serious cash. Generally, 50,000 kes. You can start lower or higher but if you need say 20k to live comfortably and that is a 10% return per month, then you can do the math on how big your account should be. Of course things like compound interest come into play but that is dependent on your skill level. I have seen people do spectacular things with very little funds.

**Taxes..?**

Talk to a lawyer or an accountant. I am neither.

**Family? Friends?**

Unfortunately, people will not understand why you spend hundreds of hours watching strangers on the internet so it is best to keep it from them. Eventually you will make it work and they will come to your corner talking about how they always knew you‚Äôd make it.

The journey will be lonely, make some trading buddies along the way. You‚Äôd be surprised at how easy it is when people are united by their circumstances (and stupidity) I have guys who are my bros from South Africa and Lebanon who I have never met but we came up together and are now homies. Join forums, ask questions and grow. That is the only way to learn. Ideally, a group of 5-10 friends committed to learning and growth is the best model. Pushing each other to grow and discovering together.

Forex is real and you can do amazing things with it. It is not a get rich quick scheme. If you want a quick guaranteed income, get a job.

And now it is 5am, fuck.

This is oversimplified and leaves out many many aspects.

Growing up my brother never did anything around the house because he is a man and men are not supposed to whatever, my mom literally made us serve him, he suffers from a bad case of weaponized incompetence.(imagine someone who has 3 kids and doesn't even know how to change a diaper and make a bottle of milk)

Since his wife left, i came around to help with the kids, it has been so hard but he is my brother. I went to school, went to work and took care of his kids and made him dinner(making him dinner is a headache he is the type to criticize food that is served to him while he is sitting in the living room watching t.v)

On Saturday i got my period, since i was not going to work or school i decided to stay in. My brother also doesn't work on Saturday's,(i figured he can take care of his kids and i can come back on Monday) i start getting phone calls from my brother demanding that I come down to his house to take care of his kids, i was already hormonal and i become angry, i told him I didn't feel good and I can't take care of his kids plus he was home.

He called my mom and my mom started blowing up my phone she told me that I had a responsibility towards my brother since i am the oldest(he is older than me i am the oldest girl) i told her that the reason why everything is happening is because of her, the reason why my brother is incompetent and why he doesn't know how to change a diaper is because of her. My mother called me selfish and she also said that it was a mistake to give birth to me. She also said i was useless and i will go to hell

After Saturday i just stopped going to my brother, house he called me numerous times to go back but i haven't. My mom can't come and help him because she is in another city, i have been feeling so guilty about all of it, i am so tired of rising other people's kids my mother had 6 kids since i am the oldest i raised 3 of my siblings.For the first time in my life i said no and stood up for myself.

tcdftt,Kenya,1647079977.0,"Throwaway account, i married my husband after high school, we were high school sweethearts. My family is very comfortable and my father runs a business which i am going to inherit.

His family is poor and my dad didn't like this and hence made my husband sign a prenup. After university my husband couldn't find work he also doesn't want to work for my dad.(my dad doesn't like him, i do my best to make sure i don't leave my husband and father in the same room)

I suggested that he doesn't have to work, because I  have enough money for the both of us. He can stay at home and if he wants to pursue other stuff he can do that. All he has to do is take care of the home. We also agreed he will get an allowance every week, an access to joint bank account for household expenditure.

We held a dinner party for potential clients and family at our home. My husband was the one talking to people he was basically hosting and serving everyone while I talked to clients.

My brother and his friends started teasing my husband about him being a stay at home husband. They started talking about how poor his family was and how he married his way out of poverty, i could see my husband was getting irritated so i stepped in and told my brother off.i told my brother and his friends that they will not come back to my house if they disrespect my husband.

I realised that i have to choose between my husband and my family. My family will not respect my husband because if his background, they think i am going to get tired of him and marry a rich man. (A family friends son)

I don't want to let go of my family but i also love my husband, how do i appease everyone without hurting either side. Him being a stay at home husband is something that works for the both of us, i don't want to change that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/tcdftt/stay_at_home_husband/,STAY AT HOME HUSBAND,,91,124,0.99

So after having my nice breakfast I took and Uber to his place( not very far from mine) and gave the lappy to a rider. Then I started wrapping his card and gift for valentines..I got him Marvel figurines (Groot and vision). I then went to his room kutafuta tape na glue( his work from desk is in his room). 
Kufungua drawer I find two empty condom boxes which we don't use and we're not there last week. Nikashikwa na mshtuko. I then decided to snoop on his computer and get it all juu weuh! 
Kumbe he's been speaking to his ex na ata the so called 'meeting' he was taking her on a date. 
Nilizima computer then I took everything that belonged to me, left and blocked the AH on every platform I could think of. Also I added pin codes so as to access each specific Netflix acc.

10nle9s,Kenya,1674929362.0,"My dad died last week. It was so unexpected yet a bit expected. He'd been sick but doing well with hope of full recovery after a required surgery. And then he just died, in hospital, during his monthly clinic. 
I had finally gotten a job so I started budgeting for a family meal out and buying him comfy clothes to wear. I had so many plans about what we'd do together now that I could afford to go somewhere on my own expense. I was planning to buy him flowers that weekend. And now he's gone. I wish I had more photos, more videos, more texts I could look at and feel his presence. Last week I had a dad, I called him and we talked for a bit before I had to go back to work. This week I don't have a dad and I feel like I should have done more. I wish I could turn back time and do the things I postponed and declined because I was tired. In the morning I wake up numb, unfeeling but as the day goes I do and see things that remind me of him. I'm reminded that no one in my family understands me the way he did, no one just lets me be me the way he did. 

How do you heal from this? People keep telling me that time will lessen the pain but do I want it to? I'm afraid I'll forget him, his voice, his scent, how he called my name and his smile.
